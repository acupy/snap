snap simulator
==============

This script simulates a simplified game of "Snap!" between two computer players using N packs of cards (standard 52 card, 4 suit packs).  The "Snap!" matching condition can be the face value of the card, the suit, or both. The program should ask:

1. how many packs of cards to use (N)
2. which of the three matching conditions to use

and then run a simulation of the cards being shuffled then played from the top of the pile.  When two matching cards are played sequentially, a player is chosen randomly as having declared "Snap!" first and takes ownership of all cards played in that run.  Play continues until the pile is completely exhausted (any cards played without ending in a "Snap!" at the time the pile is exhausted are ignored).  Tally up the total number of cards each player has accumulated and declare the winner/draw.
